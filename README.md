This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Introduction

The idea is to create a SaaS-based online education platform for countries with centralized education systems. These systems often use standardized curriculums across the country, meaning students in the same grade level study the same subjects with similar content. This project leverages a uniform curriculum to deliver a cohesive online learning experience that is accessible, personalized, and scalable.

Students will be able to select their grade level upon signing up, giving them access to all subjects relevant to their studies. Each subject is organized into chapters following the standard textbooks. For each chapter, students can access:

- Video Lessons: Instructional videos from expert teachers explain concepts.
- Textbook Content: Digital versions of official textbook text for easy reference.
- Prewritten Exercises: Practice exercises for reinforcement, allowing students to test and build their understanding.
- AI Chat Tutor: Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI, students can ask questions and receive personalized guidance, simulating a one-on-one tutoring experience.

This platform offers students a structured, guided educational journey closely aligned with their in-school curriculum and equips them with interactive tools for independent study. The use of AI as a tutor provides accessibility to personalized help for students, improving the chances of academic success.

## Project Success Factors

- Scalability: Adaptable to multiple countries with a centralized curriculum structure, supporting potential expansion.
- Cost Efficiency: Once established, content production and AI tutoring costs can be relatively low compared to live tutoring.
- Engagement: Video lessons and interactive exercises will keep students engaged.
- Accessibility: Available to students at any time, especially valuable for those with limited access to quality education or supplemental tutoring.

## Potential Challenges

- Curriculum Customization: Requires precise alignment with each countryâ€™s curriculum, potentially requiring customization.
- Content Production Costs: Initial costs for quality video production and exercise creation could be high.
- Regulatory Compliance: Different countries have distinct requirements for educational content that may require modifications.
